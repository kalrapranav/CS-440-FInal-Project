# Electronic Waste
Electronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Used electronics which are
destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal are also considered e-waste. Informal processing
of e-waste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution.

## The problem
When electronics end up in landfills, toxics like lead, mercury, and cadmium leach into the soil and water.

The electronic waste problem is huge: More than 20 million tons of e-waste are produced every year. Americans
alone generate about 3.4 million tons of e-waste per year. If you put every blue whale alive today on one side
of a scale and one year of US e-waste on the other, the e-waste would be heavier. 

## Solution
Our team **Tech Sect** cjose the topic of E-waste for the case study of our Final projetc for the class Social Ethics
and issues (CS 440) at San Diego State University. Our team wanted to create awarness about the topic so we decided to 
create a powerpoint presention, video and website for our final class presentaion

The following repository constains the files for the website including HTMl, CSS and javascript files (and other supporting docs)
